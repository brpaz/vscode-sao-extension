:information_source: You must have run a generator at least once from the command line, for it to appear on the extension.

## Requirements

This extension is only compatible with the lastest SAO v2, which is currently in Beta.

You can install it using: ```npm i -g sao@beta```

For more information, check [SAO](https://github.com/saojs/sao) on GitHub.

:warning: If you have used SAO v1 before, it is recommended to delete the "generators" section of `$HOME/.config/sao-nodejs/config.json` first to avoid old configurations.
